1. For the ScRNAseq analysis, the associated scripts are available on GitHub (https://github.com/lili-bio/ID3-KupfferCells). All the codes, analyzed RDS files, and the original data sets are available via the following link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QgZ43-FhjqUdJCUcd72Yv19fKfv0rZ8X?usp=sharing.
   
The CRC ScRNAseq dataset contained 3 colorectal liver metastasis patients and a non-tumor individual(GEO accession number: GSE146409). The PDAC ScRNAseq dataset contained 3 PDAC liver metastasis patients(P21, P25, P27, GEO accession number: GSE205013), the nontumor control contained 5 non-tumor individuals dataset (GEO accession number: GSE115469).PDAC and health datasets were integrated using the Harmony pipeline.

KCs were defined as CSF1R+ SPI1+ TIMD4+. TAMs were defined as CSF1R+ SPI1+ TIMD4- TREM2+

3. For the bulk RNAseq data, raw data are deposited to the GEO repository with GEO accession number: GSE234638. GSE234638 data are available via the following link https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE234638 with the secure token: mjyhmksynhibnst
